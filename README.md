# Audio Source Separation using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

## Overview

Welcome to the NMF Audio Source Separation project by Attix Awan! In this repository, Attix explores the application of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to separate audio sources from a mixture. The project showcases synthetic audio signal generation, visualizations of original and separated sources, and a detailed walkthrough of the NMF process.

The synthetic audio signals include sinusoidal tones and random noise, and the goal is to use NMF to extract these sources. This project is designed for those interested in audio processing, source separation techniques, and the practical application of NMF in the domain of audio analysis.



## Introduction

This project is brought to you by Attix Awan and demonstrates the use of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to separate audio sources from a mixture. The synthetic audio signals include sinusoidal tones and random noise, and the goal is to use NMF to extract these sources. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this project provides valuable insights into the practical application of NMF in audio analysis.
